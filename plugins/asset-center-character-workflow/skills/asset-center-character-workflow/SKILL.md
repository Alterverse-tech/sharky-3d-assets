# Asset Center Character Workflow

## Overview

Keep the conversation and temporary concepts in the native agent host. Make Asset Center the sole production authority after the user explicitly chooses one supported human reference.

## Best-effort update check

This loaded bundle is version `0.4.0`. On the first use of this skill in each new task, make one non-blocking update check for the current host only:

- Give the shell call a five-second timeout. In Codex, refresh `sharky-3d-assets` with `codex plugin marketplace upgrade sharky-3d-assets --json`; in Claude Code, use `claude plugin marketplace update sharky-3d-assets`.
- Read the configured marketplace root from that host's JSON marketplace list, then read the character workflow version from `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` for Codex or `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` for Claude Code.
- Only when the refreshed manifest contains a valid semantic version greater than `0.4.0`, append one short, non-blocking notice that names the available version and asks the user to say `更新插件`. Continue the character request without waiting.
- If the command fails, times out, lacks credentials, returns invalid data, or does not prove a newer version, continue silently. Do not retry or claim the plugin is current.

Never clone or pull a repository, create a scheduler, edit plugin caches, or update both hosts during this check. Only after the user explicitly asks to update, run `codex plugin add asset-center-character-workflow@sharky-3d-assets --json` in Codex or `claude plugin update asset-center-character-workflow@sharky-3d-assets --scope user` in Claude Code. Tell the user the new version loads in the next task or session.

## Route the request

Classify before calling a write tool:

- `human_biped`: one intended person or humanoid/anime character with biped proportions.
- `creature`: shark, fish, quadruped, monster anatomy, or non-biped rig. Explain that the creature production profile is not available yet. Do not create a biped workflow.
- `other`: prop, vehicle, environment, or scene. Use the matching Asset Center route when available; do not disguise it as a character workflow.
- `ambiguous`: ask one focused question about the intended subject or output.

## Prepare and select the source

For a text-only human request, use the host's installed image-generation capability to create one to three temporary, full-character concepts. Show them in native chat and wait for the user to select one.

For an attached human image:

- If the user says to use it exactly, present it as the sole candidate and ask for confirmation.
- If the user asks for visual changes, create temporary variants and wait for a choice.
- If image generation is unavailable, ask for a local reference image. Never fabricate a file path.

Temporary candidates are not workflow artifacts. Do not call `create_character_workflow` before a choice. Upload only the selected image with `attach_character_source`.

## Advance the shared workflow

1. Call `create_character_workflow` once with a stable `clientRequestId` and the current host client.
2. Call `attach_character_source` with the returned `workflowId` and `version`.
3. Return the `workbenchUrl`; the browser and native chat now refer to the same opaque workflow ID.
4. Route the T-Pose step from the current host's capabilities, regardless of `workflow.origin`. A workflow created by Claude may later continue in Codex, and vice versa.
5. When the current host is Codex Desktop with native image understanding and imagegen:
   - Understand and summarize the selected source in Codex. Do not call backend `analyze-image` or `generate-tpose` on this Codex-native branch.
   - Describe the exact T-Pose operation and wait for explicit approval.
   - Call `materialize_character_source`, then invoke native imagegen exactly once with that local reference for the approved attempt.
   - Review the one result in Codex, prepare `analysis` and `qualityReport`, and call `attach_character_tpose` exactly once. Generate and import exactly one candidate per approved attempt.
   - Show the imported preview and report from the refreshed workflow. Advisory warnings are shown without automatic regeneration. Wait for acceptance or an explicit request for one more version.
   - Older candidates remain workflow history; the latest imported candidate becomes active.
6. In Claude Code, or any current host without native imagegen, retain the existing backend path: automatically start `analyze-image` after source attachment, wait and report it, then require explicit approval before starting backend `generate-tpose`.
7. Explicit confirmation remains required for `generate-model`, candidate selection, and publishing. Summarize the exact operation before generation and wait for the user's approval.
   - When a refreshed result contains top-level `previewUrl`, include it in the completion report as `[直接预览模型](<previewUrl>)`. This stable anonymous page opens the GLB itself rather than the Workbench canvas.
   - Use the stable top-level `previewUrl`, not an artifact's expiring signed `previewUrl` or `downloadUrl`.
   - Every time the completion report names a ready GLB file, use its entry from `deliveries` and include all four: `文件：<fileName>`, `[直接预览模型](<previewUrl>)` (or `[直接预览动作模型](<previewUrl>)` for an action), a Markdown download link from `downloadUrl`, and `[画布中预览模型](<workbenchUrl>)`.
   - Download URLs are refreshed signed links. If a named ready GLB has no `downloadUrl`, call `get_character_workflow` once to refresh it. If it is still absent, say `下载链接暂不可用` next to that file; never silently omit the download line.
8. Reload with `get_character_workflow` immediately before any later mutation because the user may have acted in the browser Inspector.
9. Use `confirm_character_output` only after the user names a T-Pose or static-model candidate, or the browser already marks that choice active. After the user confirms the final static model, pass `nextCommand: rig-check`; a successful Rig Check may continue into `rig` through the existing orchestrator without another prompt.
10. When the validated sole active rigged output is ready, confirm it and present action selection without another binding confirmation.
11. Use `select_character_actions` only after the user explicitly chooses the action list. Automatically start `retarget` with the returned latest version, call `wait_character_workflow`, and report the results without another start confirmation.
   - When Retarget finishes with `ready_to_publish`, the top-level `previewUrl` points to the first selected successful action and opens directly in the anonymous animated model viewer. Report it as `[直接预览动作模型](<previewUrl>)` before asking whether to publish, and also include `[画布中预览模型](<workbenchUrl>)`.
   - `actionPreviewUrls` contains each successful selected action's file name, stable direct viewer link, and refreshed download link. Include a download link for every successful action named in the report.
12. Call `publish_character_workflow` only after an immediate explicit publish confirmation; set `confirmedByUser: true`.

## Version conflicts

Every write uses `expectedVersion`. If a tool returns `stale_version`, inspect `latest`:

- If the browser already performed the requested action, acknowledge it and continue from the new version.
- Otherwise explain that the workflow changed elsewhere and ask once before sending the write again.
- Never automatically replay a paid stage, confirmation, or publish call.

## Quick reference

| Intent | Tool |
|---|---|
| Create the formal draft after source selection | `create_character_workflow` |
| Upload only the chosen reference | `attach_character_source` |
| Cache the active source for Codex-native imagegen | `materialize_character_source` |
| Import one Codex-native T-Pose and its report | `attach_character_tpose` |
| Refresh browser/native shared state | `get_character_workflow` |
| Wait for provider completion | `wait_character_workflow` |
| Start an explicitly approved or prerequisite-authorized stage | `start_character_stage` |
| Select and confirm a generated output | `confirm_character_output` |
| Choose up to the workflow action limit | `select_character_actions` |
| Publish after immediate confirmation | `publish_character_workflow` |

## Common mistakes

- Creating a draft for every concept pollutes workflow history; wait for selection.
- Treating the browser as a second workflow creates divergence; always use the returned `workflowId`.
- Calling backend `analyze-image` or `generate-tpose` from the Codex-native branch bypasses the host-capability route.
- Starting `generate-tpose` or `generate-model` from inferred intent, or starting an automatic stage before its documented prerequisite, violates the confirmation boundary.
- Regenerating automatically because of advisory quality warnings spends another attempt without approval; show the warning and wait.
- Retrying 409 automatically can duplicate a user's browser action.
- Sending sharks or quadrupeds into the biped path produces invalid T-Poses and rigs; stop at the capability boundary.
- Adding a chat surface inside Asset Center duplicates the native host; the browser remains canvas plus Inspector only.
